  For Bite Squad, user experience is paramount. We wanted insight into how our customers were using our app, and ways to improve their experience. Esra and her team did a fantastic job conducting a usability study on our behalf. Their study was organized and thorough, which enabled us to confirm a handful of assumptions we made. But more importantly, their study shed light on a few pain points and usage patterns we did not expect! With this new data, we were able to revise the app, thereby improving the experience for our customers. We look forward to working with Esra again!

  Most of the time, what we have in mind as website editors does not match with what the audience perceives or expects to see on our sites. Esra helped us a great deal in bridging this gap. She was thorough and organized during the whole process. She was very insightful about our needs and incorporated our input into her research questions while in return providing us with very clear and applicable feedback. Anyone who has a chance to work with her will be very lucky and I am looking forward to benefit from her skills and work ethic again soon.
