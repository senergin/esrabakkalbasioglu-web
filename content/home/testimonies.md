  For Bite Squad, user experience is paramount. We wanted insight into how our customers were using our app, and ways to improve their experience. Esra and her team did a fantastic job conducting a usability study on our behalf. Their study was organized and thorough, which enabled us to confirm a handful of assumptions we made. But more importantly, their study shed light on a few pain points and usage patterns we did not expect! With this new data, we were able to revise the app, thereby improving the experience for our customers. We look forward to working with Esra again!
