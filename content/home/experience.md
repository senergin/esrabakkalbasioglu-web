  I have worked in the coordination of IT, engineering, and business PMs and shipment of the ITA partner onboarding to the new billing platform. I met with our partner teams to find the root causes of the existing inefficiencies in project delivery. My findings turned into three separate projects. I prepared a visual report on project latency covering the last five years on PowerBI to be shared with the leadership. I automated a system generating weekly workload dashboards using a large dataset from SharePoint. I coded an automated follow-up system to be regularly shared with IT and engineering teams. This system reduced latency around 35 percent.
