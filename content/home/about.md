# Biography

I am a User Experience (UX) Researcher with extended experience in multi-leveled human-centered research and project management. I believe good research can change the world. 

I have conducted various innovative research projects combining qualitative and quantitative methods, including moderated and automated usability testings, surveys, interviews, and field visits. On top of my expertise in research, I have professional project management experience and a long track record of customer engagement, cross-team collaboration, and technical and non-technical communication.
