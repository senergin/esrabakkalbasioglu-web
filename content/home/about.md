# Biography

I am a User Experience (UX) Researcher and a problem-solver. I currently work with startups and help them to design better products using my research insights.

As a Ph.D. candidate at UW studying Anthropology/Political Science, I have single-handedly conducted various innovative research projects combining qualitative and quantitative methods. I am using the same precise critical thinking on my design research work.

I have a long track record of project management, cross-team collaboration, partner-customer engagement, and ability to translate research to technical and non-technical stakeholders.
