# Biography

I am a User Experience (UX) Researcher with extended experinece in multi-leveled human-centered research and project management. I believe good research can change the world. 

As a Ph.D. candidate at UW studying Anthropology/Political Science, I have conducted various innovative research projects combining qualitative and quantitative methods. I am using the same precise critical thinking when I conduct design research work.

I have a long track record of project management, customer engagement, cross-team collaboration across engineering, desing, business teams, and translating research findings and insights to technical and non-technical stakeholders. 

Below you can find some of the testimonies from my partners and customers.

# Recommendations

**Sal Habash, VP of product at Bite Squad** 

> "Esra did an amazing job structuring our usability study and surfacing valuable insights with actionable suggestions. We couldnâ€™t be happier with her process and results!"

**Anthony Young, Principal Software Engineer at Bite Squad** 

> "For Bite Squad, user experience is paramount. We wanted insight into how our customers were using our app, and ways to improve their experience. Esra and her team did a fantastic job conducting a usability study on our behalf. Their study was organized and thorough, which enabled us to confirm a handful of assumptions we made. But more importantly, their study shed light on a few pain points and usage patterns we did not expect! With this new data, we were able to revise the app, thereby improving the experience for our customers. We look forward to working with Esra again!"
