# App & Website Testing for Food Delivery Startup

## Challenges:
BiteSquad was about to launch in 200 new locations. Before this big step, they wanted to be sure that the new interface work as planned. They have specific usability questions but also wanted to evaluate their app in comparison to other applications.

## Process:

### 1. Automated Usability Testing
I designed a remote automated usability test for the BiteSquad website on usertesting.com. The goal was to elicit information from them about user-friendliness and appeal of the BiteSquad in comparison to the competitor; which aspect of the BiteSquad website appeal them the most, would they prefer this service to the competitor? 

Participants were given three different scenarios and asked to complete certain tasks based on the concerns and priorities of the BiteSquad design and engineering teams. I also asked them to complete the same task on the website of the competitor. I analyzed video recording of the users and prepared an initial report on the potential painpoints to be share with my co-researcher and the BiteSquad teams.

### 2. Moderated Usability Testing
With the information collected from the participants of automated usability test of the website, together with my co-researcher, we prepared a combined usability and competitive test for the BiteSquad IOS app that was recently completed.

Together with the design teams we came up with four potentially problematic areas. Based on this information, we asked the participants to complete four different tasks including adding to the cart, removing from the cart, submit a complaint, finding a specific food type or cuisine.

**One of the Key Insights:** Users find it hard to remove items from the cart.

> “Adding to the cart was quite easy. I went into the cart. It is not immediately clear how to delete. Clicking the one and making it a zero. I expect to see an “x” sign.” –Participant #3 

> “There should be an option to change the number of items on your cart. Here there is only “add more items.” –Participant #2

We asked the participants to complete the same exact tasks on the competitor’s app. We recorded their success. We also ask them to compare the apps in every stage. At the end, we conducted an exit interview to get their ideas on what they expect to see in a food delivery app and how they define their ideal app. 
Design Principles:
Based on what we had learned along the research, we put together a set of suggestions for design teams to inform what the end solution should be like: 

* Adding pictures for each restaurant; or clustering restaurants featuring pictures (and those that do not) together.
* Differentiating “Recommended” filter from “Most Popular”.
* Including distance or delivery time to the home screen and/or to distance filter.
* Making “remove from cart” option easier to identify on the checkout screen.
* Incorporating options for paying with PayPal or ApplePay.
* Incorporating options for signing in directly via their FaceBook and/or Google accounts.

## Outcome:
After giving our final presentation to design and engineering leadership, this project has continued to progress. Based on the insights from the research participants and suggestions from us, the researchers, the teams decided to incorporate the above-stated changes to their product. We can’t wait to see the new interface and test it.
