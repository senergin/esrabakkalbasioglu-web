# Surveying Preferences, Habits, and Concerns of Online Shopping Customers
\
\
## Challenges:
Bohemtolia, a shopping website for home decor items, was about to make changes on their website interface to increase their sale. Before takign any step, they wanted to make sure that this is the right step to take. 
\
\
\
## Process:

### 1. Analysis of Log Data
During our meetings, it turned out to be that the Bohemtolia team was not sure if their lower than anticipated sale level was the result of a usability issue or something else. To clarify the situation, I checked their google analytics data and prepared a report to the shared with the customer. The report clarified that the website did not have a serious usability issue.
\
\
**Key Insights:** 

* Visitor flow around the website was stable. There was no high drop out from any one of the pages. It was considerably easy to navigate in the website.
* Even though there was a high bounce rate, the visitors that do not close the website immediately were spending a good amount of time checking various collections and items on the website.

Based on the findings that the website did not have a serious usability issue, we decided to focus more on potential customers' online shopping preferences, concerns, and habits. To gain insights on these areas, we decided to design a survey that would be launched in Turkey and the United States, the countries from where the website had the highest number of visitors.

### 2. Survey Brainstorming
During our survey brainstorming meetings with Bohemtolia team, we come with with a list of potential issue area that the team want to learn more about in order the shape their mnarketing strategies accordingly. I conducted an online research on which ones of these issue areas to eliminate the ones that have been answered in previous "online shopping trends" surveys conducted with similar target audiences. After eliminated the areas for which we already have the answers, we came up with three areas that were crucial for Bohemtolia to shape its strategy and were not answered by previous surveys and research.

### 3. Survey Preparation and Launch
As this was an online survey, I decided to ask only ten questions including the demographics questions to increase the completion rate as much as possible. I prepared an identical survey in English and Turkish on qualtrics and we launched both survey in the same month.
