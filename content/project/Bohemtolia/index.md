# Customer Preferences and Concerns Survey for Home Decor Brand Website 
\
\
## Challenges:
[Bohemtolia] (https://bohemtolia.com/?lang=en), a home decor brand website, was about to make changes on their website interface to increase their sale. Before taking any step, they wanted to make sure that this is the right thing to do. 
\
\
\
## Process:

### 1. Log Data Analysis
During our meetings, it turned out to be that the Bohemtolia team was not sure if their lower than anticipated sale level was the result of a usability issue or not. To understand if the low conversion is a usability-related problem, I checked their google analytics data and prepared a report underlying their strengths and weaknesses.

\
**Key Findings:** 

* Visitor flow around the website was high and diverse. There was no high drop out from any one of the pages. The website was considerably easy to navigate. Visitors were spending a good amount of time checking various collections.

* Yet there was a high bounce rate and low conversion rate.

Based on these findings we concluded that usability was not the first concern. We decided to focus more on potential customers' online shopping preferences, concerns, and habits to make according changes to cater their needs. To gain insights on these areas, I decided to design an online survey.

### 2. Survey Brainstorming
During our survey brainstorming meetings with Bohemtolia team, we come with with a list of potential questions. I conducted an online market research to eliminate the questions that already have answers. Based on the log data, market research, and brainstroming session, I shortened the question list and issue areas.

### 3. Survey Preparation and Launch
I prepared a 10-questions online survey on Qualtrics (I initially prepared the survey both on [Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com) and [SurveyMonkey](https://www.surveymonkey.com) but ultimately decided to preceed with Qualtrics). 

Following the demographic questions, the survey focused three issue areas: General online shopping preferences, online home decor shopping preferences, and online home decor shopping concerns. 

We decided to launch the survey in Turkish for potential customers in Turkey and in English for potential customers Europe and the United States. The survey in Turkish was completed by 131 participants in mid-March 2019 and the survey in English by 80 participants in early-April.

## Key Findings:

* Bohemtolia's products are not in high demand among online home decoration shoppers in Turkey but in demand in Europe and the United States. 
* Online shoppers like shooping from brand websites if it is promoted by a friend or have an ad on a trusted website. Amazon is big in Europe and the US as a home decor shopping website but not in Turkey.
* Everywhere, online shoppers are most worried about quality, size, and color of the home decor products they buy online.

## Output:
Results from the two surveys pointed 3 main issue areas for Bohemtolia to focus: building trust, increasing the brand visibility, and targeting potential customers outside of Turkey. I prepared and shared with Bohemtolia team a powerpoint presentation showing the data distributions, the main findings, and my suggestions on how to achieve them.

## Outcome:
Bohemtolia team started to shape their marketing and product line strategies accordingly. I look forward to seeing measurable impacts of the changes that started to be implemented in April 2019.
