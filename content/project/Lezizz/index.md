# Food and Recipe Website Testing for Lezizz
\
\
## Challenges:
[Turkish national newspaper Hurriyet's food and recipe website Lezizz](http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/lezizz/) is launched in 2017. Before making UI changes, the website editors wanted to learn more about the usability of the existing interface and how their potential audience uses their website. They wanted to test the usability of some of the existing features to get ideas on how to develop them.
\
\
\
## Process:

### 1. Moderated Remote and Face-to-Face Usability Test
The Lezizz website was only in Turkish. So for this research, I decided to recruit participants from Turkey who would search for recipes in their native language. We decided that the target audience for this recipe and food website would 
be people working or eager to try new recipes. Based on the insights from the product teams on the existing and targeted user demographics, I decided to recruit 5 participants (3 females and 2 males) from Turkey, working outside of home and having limited time to cook. I also decided to strenghten my sample by recruiting majority (3 out of 5) of my participants from the Turkish expat community as they have considerably limited access to their family recipes and tend to search Turkish recipes online very often. As I was located in the US, I recruited the expat participants from the US and conducted the usability test face-to-face with them. I used [UberConference](https://www.uberconference.com) to schedule and conduct the remote moderated usability tests with the participants living in Turkey.

At the beginning of each test, I conducted a pre-test interview with each participant to collect data on user personas, gather information on potential users’ recipe research habits as well as their favorite recipe and food apps and websites. Following this initial interview, I gave the participants 3 seperate scenarios and ask them to complete specific tasks such as finding a recipe on the website, searching for an article, and using recipe search engine to find suitable appetizer recipes for 5 vegetarian people. Throughout the test, I probe questions for participants to use and comment on different tools and pages of the website and asked their feedback on the website design and appeal.

**One of the Key Insights:** Users find it hard to differentiate different between different tabs. 

> "I do not understand the difference between 'Food Culture' and 'What to Eat Where?'" –Participant #2

> "There are more recipes than tips under 'Kitchen Tips' tap. I would expect to see more life hacks and tricks here." –Participant #5

Following the usability test, I conducted post-test interview with each participant to gain insights on overall user-friendliness and appeal of the website and to learn more about their expectations from their 'ideal' recipe and food website.

## Output:
Based on what I had learned along the research, I put together a detailed powerpoint presentation on each task highligting the overall and most serious issues that need to be fixed. For each issue area, I provided some short and long-term solutions, suggested new directions for research and development.

## Outcome:
The product leaders decided to work on some of the issues immediately, such as fixing the broken buttons, and incorporate the rest to their new design cycle that will start in mid-2019. I can’t wait to see the results!
