# Infrastructure Research & Strategy

## Challenges:
In the Southeastern region of Turkey, illegal electricity use was around 90 percent. Compared to around 15% country average, these figures were not only outliers that trigger various questions on distribution and access to infrastructure in the region. Turkish government was about to introduce new and harsher methods to stop illegal use of electricity in the Southeastern region of the country. As my Ph.D. dissertation, I develop an ethnographic research project to understand the process of illegal access to infrastructure and develop strategies to decrease high illegal energy use percentage in the region. 

## Process:

### 1. Survey
To get a snapshot of the composition, satisfaction, and values of the users in the region, I run a small-n survey with 30 participants. The survey covered both their everyday electricity usage patterns as well as their thoughts on high illegal electricity use in the region. The goal of the survey was to get an idea on the general trends and issues raised about electricity provision and consumption in the region. 

One of the Key Insights: Agriculture is considered to be the primary reason of extremely high illegal electricity consumption in the region. 

### 2. Interviews with farmers
Based on the key insight of the survey, I decided to recruit individual working in agricultural sector. I conducted in-depth interviews with more than 20 farmers owning small, mid-size, and large agricultural lands in the region. I asked them about type of agriculture (dry or irrigated) they conduct, difficulties in access to water and high illegal electricity use’s relation with agricultural production in the region, as well as their expectation from the state agents. 

### 3. Interviews with Bureaucrats and Technocrats
To test farmers’ arguments and see the viability of their demands, I conducted in-depth interviews with bureaucrats and technocrats located in the capital city and in the region, who are responsible from electricity and irrigation water distribution policies and operations in the region. 

### 4. Field Visits
I visited agricultural areas and learned from farmers how they took their illegal connections to the grid system. I also visited urban neighborhood with highest illegal household electricity use as well as Research and Development Department of the regional electricity distribution firm to see the smart meters they develop to prevent illegal access.

## Key Findings and Recommendations:
* A very high percentage of illegal electricity consumed in the Southeastern Anatolia region of Turkey was outcome of illegal electricity use in agriculture.
* The state provided irrigation canals to the region, but they are distributed highly unequally.
* Farmers who do not have access to state irrigation canals use electricity illegally to pump up the deep groundwater and irrigate their crops.
* Even though electricity company tries to develop new measures to prevent illegal use, there is a need of immediate policy change from the state.
* The state can reduce illegal access to electricity by:
  * Completing distribution of irrigation canals in the region
  * Providing an electricity discount to farmers
  * Buying dry crops to a higher price to prevent the shift to irrigated agriculture among the farmers who do not have access to irrigation canals.
