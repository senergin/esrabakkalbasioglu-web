# README
This is the portolio/website of [Esra Bakkalbasioglu](https://www.esrabakkalbasioglu.com/).
I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Academic template](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/academic/) to set this site up. It's pretty dope, would recommend.

## How to run?
1. Install Hugo. Check [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website for instructions.
2. Clone and navigate to repo directory.
3. Run the Hugo server (enter "hugo server" to terminal).
4. It should be up and running on localhost at this point.
