# README
This is the portolio/website of [Esra Bakkalbasioglu](https://www.esrabakkalbasioglu.com/).
I used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Academic template](https://themes.gohugo.io/theme/academic/) to set this site up. It's pretty dope, would recommend.

## How to run?
1. Install Hugo
2. Clone and navigate to repo directory
3. hugo server
4. It should be up and running on localhost at this point.
